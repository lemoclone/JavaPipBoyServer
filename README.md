# JavaPipBoyServer 
A Fallout 4 PipBoy compatible server implementation.

#### Working:
- Discovery
- KeepAlive
- Database + structure
- Packaging data for sending
- First project which uses tests `:D` [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/luckydonald/JavaPipBoyServer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/luckydonald/JavaPipBoyServer)


#### Known Bugs
 - not complete
 - this is pre-alpha.
 - Currently Discovery is working, and it stayes connected, but the mobile apps don't display any data (changes). The reason why I yet have to figure out.
 - you might be able to get this working with iOS, but I don't have a new enough device, so I can't say with any certainty.
 - Not compatible with Python 2.7

#### Roadmap
 - Fix Server.

#### FAQ
- Will it emulate the PC or PS4?

    > You can choose either.

- Will it emulate the XBOX?
 
    > XBOX uses smartglass, which works totally differently than the PC server would.
  
 - Why is this not Python 2.7 compatible? 
 
    > Because Python 3 and unicode strings are the future!
    > Aaand because this project is in java.
