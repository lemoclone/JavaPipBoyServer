#### Known Bugs

 - not complete
 - [this isn't working](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-gPZv9-XHc)
 - this is a hack.
 - you might be able to get this working with iOS and an Xbox/PS4, but I don't have either, so I can't say with any certainty.  I do know that smartglass works differently than a PC server would.
 - not quite Python3 compatible.
